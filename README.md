## 🧠 Model Details

### Architecture
- Transfer Learning
- MobileNetV2 (ImageNet Pretrained)
- Custom classification head

### Training Strategy
- **Phase 1 — Feature Extraction**
  - Base MobileNetV2 frozen
  - Only custom layers trained

- **Phase 2 — Fine Tuning**
  - Top layers of MobileNetV2 unfrozen
  - Lower learning rate used
  - Improved accuracy

### Dataset
Plant leaf disease dataset containing 5 tomato disease classes:

- Early Blight
- Healthy
- Late Blight
- Leaf Mold
- Septoria Leaf Spot

### Performance
- **Test Accuracy:** ~88%
- Image size: 224×224
- Model optimized using TensorFlow Lite for faster inference
